# This is the unique pattern ID.
#
# It is possible to define multiple patterns in a YML file, each with it's own
# unique ID. However, I personally think that it is more logical to have one
# pattern per file to keep them well-separated and organized.
#
# You can however, group similar patterns in a file.
# Example:
#   - button
#   - button_with_icon
#
card_ombreggiata:
  # The label and description are used in the Drupal UI and the pattern library.
  label: 'Card Ombreggiatura'
  description: Card che può essere utilizzata per la visualizzazione di contenuti.
  variants:
    default:
      label: Default
      description: Default.
  # Fields of data supported by the pattern.
  # This can include optional fields which you can handle in your TWIG.
  fields:
    title:
      type: text
      label: Title
      description: The title of the card.
      preview: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit…'
    text:
      type: text
      label: Text
      description: Text of the card.
      preview: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'
    readmore_link:
      type: text
      label: read more link
      description: Link to circolari.
      preview: '#'
  # Optional: Attached libraries.
  #
  # You can include libraries defined by other modules / themes with dependencies.
  #
  # These libraries are also available for include in theme libraries as
  # dependencies. Doing this ensures that the CSS / JS for the pattern are loaded
  # irrespective of whether a pattern of that type appears on the page.
  #   Example: ui_patterns/button.button
  libraries:
    -
      card_ombreggiata:
        css:
          component:
            css/card_ombreggiata.css: {}

  # Optional: Specify a TWIG template with 'use'.
  #
  #   Example:
  #     use: 'themes/custom/THEME/patterns/blockquote/blockquote.html.twig'
  #
  # This usually contains a path relative to the Drupal root. Some documentation
  # says that a theme-relative path can also be used, but it didn't work for me.
  #
  #   Example:
  #     use: '@oldie/patterns/blockquote/blockquote.html.twig' (didn't work)
  #
  # Alternatively, you can use the 'components' module to have better-looking
  # and flexible paths.
  #
  #   Examples:
  #     use: '@patterns/blockquote/blockquote.html.twig'
  #     use: '@blockquote/blockquote.html.twig'
  #
  # Not defining 'use' makes the UI Patterns module look for a template with
  # the name 'pattern-PATTERN.html.twig. Underscores are changed into dashes.
  #
  #   Example: pattern-blockquote.html.twig
