No Non-breaking Space Filter is a very simple filter module that deletes all non-breaking spaces (&amp;nbsp&#59;) and does nothing else.

All non-breaking space HTML entities are replaced by blank space characters. Multiple contiguous space characters are replaced by a single blank space character.

Of course the non-breaking space HTML entity has its right to exist. But serveral consecutive non-breaking space entities in a contiguous text break all typographical rules. But when texts are copied from text processors like Microsoft Office Word or Libreoffice Writer into the Drupal WYSIWIG editors, it can happen, what not should happen ...

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3>Text format filter</h3>

Go to <em>Administration » Configuration » Content authoring » Text formats</em> (<code>admin/config/content/formats</code>) to enable this filter on your existing text formats or create a new text format ...

... and finally get rid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;formated texts like this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example.

There is only one additional setting: Preserve placeholders (by default not enabled). A placeholder non-breaking space is surrounded by a HTML tag, for example &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;nbsp;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;.

<h3>Field formatter</h3>

Got to <em>Administration » Structure » Content types » Your content type » Manage display</em> (<code>admin/structure/types/manage/<content-type>/display</code>) and select the field formatter.
